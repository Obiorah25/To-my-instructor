# To-my-instructor

"Hello Emmanuel Tosin ( Master Shifu ),

First, I want to thank you for all the guidance, patience, and encouragement you've given throughout this Bootcamp. This has been an intense learning journey, and I’m really proud of how much I’ve grown with your help. I’ve gained so many valuable skills, and I owe a lot of that to your teaching and the real-world insights you shared.

As I transition from Bootcamp into the software development field, I know there will be challenges ahead. I’d really appreciate it if I could occasionally reach out for advice or feedback, especially as I work on new projects or navigate the job search. Your experience would be invaluable to me as I take these next steps, and any guidance you can offer would make a big difference.

Thank you again for everything—I’m grateful to have had you as an instructor and mentor."
